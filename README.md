# Data Analysis of Data Manipulation: Implications and Corrective Strategies

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data to produce a paper of a simulated exercise to understand the impact of data processing errors on statistical analysis. By generating a dataset and introducing errors, I explore the effects of such errors on the analysis and discuss strategies to solve these issues.

## File Structure
- `outputs` folder contains the paper and its Quarto file, as well as references
- `script` folder contains a R file that simulate the error data

## LLM Statement
- This project did not use LLM
